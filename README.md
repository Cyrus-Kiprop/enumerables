Additional description about the project and its features.
 >The code base is pretty straight forward as it involves adding custom methods into the Ruby's enumerable module.  Whats follows is a glimpse of the recreated methods and its Ruby's equivalent method. All the recreated methods are prefixed with "my_" to to avoid conflicts with the original Ruby methods.

 | Original Method  | Recreated Method |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| each  | my_each  |
| each_with_index | my_each_with_index  |
| map | my_inject   |
| all?  | my_all?  |
| map  | my_map  |
| any?  | my_any?  |
| none? | My_none?  |
| count  | my_count  |
| select  | my_select  |
